# above the frontmatter are balanced and in order while enclosing nothing, so a
# re-scaffold would preserve an empty region and overwrite every real value.
# These are the fields that would be lost, so they are what gets asserted.
#
# Only content a rule cannot derive is listed here. Every top-level frontmatter
# key is required inside the region automatically -- enumerating them invites
# exactly the drift the markers guard against, since a field added to the
# template later would be silently unprotected.
#
# Each document also declares the exact comment form its markers must take and
# whether they have to sit inside YAML frontmatter. The token alone is not
# enough on either count: a marker that loses its "#" stops being a comment and
# becomes a stray line among the fields, and a start marker moved above the
# opening "---" leaves a document whose YAML block is no longer frontmatter at
# all -- both of which passed while validation stayed green.
